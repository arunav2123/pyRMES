# pyRMS
 Reduced resistive MHD Solver(RMS) for both time-dependent and eigenvalue problems (for a given safety factor profile, resistivity, and viscosity) in cylindrical geometry (in the limit of zero plasma beta)
 
 This tool is written in Python 3.10.9, suitable for - 
 1. Linear stable and unstable tearing mode and spectrum analysis (with complex eigenvalues). 
 2. Unstable tearing modes ( with almost real eigenvalue near marginal stability threshold).
 3. Resistive growth rates of unstable modes.
